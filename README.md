Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

- To setup upon cloning or dowloading

All goods na yan.

Pag gusto nyo naman i try pwede kayo mag setup ng database sa .env file

Tas sa postman yung url localhost:8000/login  then form data email and password
